gaf-footprints
==============

footprints for use with pcb in the gaf/gEDA suite 

For creating more footprints, there is a short [reference
key](gEDA-pcb-element-reference.txt) available

New footprints families are added using the Python [footgen module](http://github.com/miloh/footgen.git), forked from the [original](http://github.com/dlharmon/footgen.git), modified from exisiting symbols with credit given to the origin, or drawn painstakingly by hand
