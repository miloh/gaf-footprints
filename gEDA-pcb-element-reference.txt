# The following elements can be used to create a gEDA pcb layout footprint

# Element [ SFlags "Desc" "Name" "Value" MX MY TX TY TDir Scale TSFlags](

# notes:
#   "SFlags" == symbolic flags.  Note sflags is the leading attribute,
# however in following pad and pin elements it is the trailing attribute.

# SFlags is where the pin part gets various values:
# "", "pin, via, hole, showname, onsolder, square, octogon, edge2"
