# The following elements can be used to create a gEDA pcb layout footprint

# Element [ SFlags "Desc" "pcb-name" "value" MX MY TX TY TDir Scale TSFlags](
# Pad        [ x1 y1 x2 y2 thickness clear mask "name" "pad_number" sflags]
# Pin        [ rX  rY Thickness Clearance Mask Drill "Name" "Number" SFlags]
# ElementLine[ rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2  silk thicknessmil]
# ElementArc [ rX rY Width Height StartAngle DeltaAngle Thickness]
)

# notes:
#   "SFlags" == symbolic flags.  Note sflags is the leading attribute,
# however in following pad and pin elements it is the trailing attribute.
#
# SFlags is where the pin part gets various values:
# "", "pin, via, hole, showname, onsolder, square, octagon, edge2"
# "", "nopaste, onsolder, square (round=default),warn,edge2"
#

These elements are used in layouts, but can be converted to the
ElementLine element above in editor or gui
# Line [ x1 y1 x2 y2 thickness clear "sfflags"]
# Via  [ X1 y1 thickness  clearance  mask drill  "name" "sfflags?"]
